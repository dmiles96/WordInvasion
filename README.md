# Word Invasion

__WARNING!__ Ten year old code base, ahead! :)

I wrote this years ago, as an homage to one of my favorite DOS programs as a kid: Typing Tutor IV. It came with a game called Letter Invaders, which I became obsessed with. So, I tried to recreate it, here, changing out monocrhome graphics for an 8-bit retro feel and porting it to Flash. I also added a few features like power-ups.

I uploaded the game to Kongregate YEARS ago, and [you can still play it there](https://www.kongregate.com/games/dmiles96/word-invaders), today


The IBM PC I played it on is long gone, but today, [you can play the Apple II version](https://archive.org/details/Typing_Tutor_IV) in a WASM-based emulator.
